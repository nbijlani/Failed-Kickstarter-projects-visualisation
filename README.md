This goal of this project is analyze the nature of failed projects on Kickstarter.com based on publicly available data from kaggle.com for the duration 2008-2016. Kickstarter.com is a hugely popular web site for creative projects, where an individual with an idea for a creative project within any of a number of available diverse categories such as software, food, crochet, photo, DIY etc., may upload details of their work-in-progress project, along with a brief campaign for funding, fulfilment plans, funding goal and deadline. Members of the public who have previously signed up to the site can pledge funding for the promised return and a project is successful if, within the deadline, it reaches its funding goal, and failed if it receives partial or no funding. This visualization aims to shed light on the different aspects of failed projects in those categories which have seen greater than a 50% failure rate, in Tableau story form, looking at their funding profile, trend over time, average backing dollars, and countries where the most failed projects were launched from.
